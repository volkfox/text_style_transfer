      " obvious in the very beginning of life to let such a grand, and wise, and just and merciful Godhead work for a moment, so that all might be revealed — which is what good faith is all about, what respect, which is everything. We mustn’t make the first bargain yet, my sweet Joan. You might say I had my little fillylike [kissing the girl on the cheek] today. Now let me tell you, there are some things, Betty, that seem awfully silly. Piffle, freak, flap. And what about braces and wings and [breathing the same barely audible] \"birdies?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, no, Joan, you always find a way. All right, all right, we can't afford them all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, Betty, we thought you might like braces and wings. Actually, they are making us even. It is we who bought them, not them.”\n",

      "“And what about a little plastic surgery?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is exactly what we were afraid of. So let’s not splutter yet. Now look, we have a surprise for you. In point of fact, we are turning our eyes away from the mirror, face down.”\n",

      "“Without looking,” replied Joan with a coy snicker.\n",

      "\n",
      "“Yes, it is strange. And what is more, we are ashamed to the point of being mistaken. We wanted to make a better man. That’s not for nought.”\n",

      "\n",
      "“Soonest, I guess. But what is more, I am absolutely certain that I can’t do it by myself any more. It seems to me monstrously chaste to forego the pleasures of thousands and thousands of beautiful, healthy, enormously powerful women, suddenly disabled and restrained by an implacable loneliness and an intense tenderness. Is it not sin in a secret night?… Indeed, I sometimes giggle, as a faint little giggle, at the funny story people give of dim-blue, slimy lobster tails getting their unbearable green thumbs sucked by the huge Danes. Betty, do you ever give yourself away?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Give yourself away,” said Betty, “that’s the funny part. A man who thinks women can’t figure anything out, who insists on being taken for an idiot if he happens to be mistaken about something, suddenly discovers an organ and the power to perform that operation—I know, I know it can all be done by you, because you yourself gave birth to that machine; why, you yourself manufacture all the materials. Now I have given it to you by the way; how hard was it to get it running? It must have cost a dozen rubles, or something. Please, explain that to me easily.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, let’s be reasonable. A cheap thrill, I imagine. In any case it’s a thrill. You saw the poor girl how she had raised her two little daughters. Now let’s talk costs. How much did she expect to make?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s right. Piffle. Oh, she did buy a nice little purse for her fourth girl.”\n",

      "\n",

He tried again: he spoke almost in a whisper, with a glint of gipsy rʙs—and remembered the clever congrection with which he successfully sucked the saliva off an expired tooth. A twitching of the heart, a kind of signal that the action had reached its climax, complete with a hiccough, and all the rhythmical variables of which a connoisseur of rhythm could have appropriateized—but here Piffke was not there anymore, and the same thing happened at every turn of the book: the right-hand page became darkly drafty, the left suddenly opaque, the center firmly tucked up—and suddenly a light broke through, and the window of the piano loft opened with an ecstatic crash and\n",

      "I took advantage of it. The room was vacant, nothing happened, I landed on the sofa, still sobbing. A thought stabbed me: at some indefinite point during the night … some act … a catch phrase … would there not be a thought that perhaps in an adjoining room … an identical twin of my fate … my own death … the same room … but, of course, the thought would come later. What would I do in such a dream … I paced the room, shook the chair, pawed at various objects … looked into the mirror, ran my fingers over the inside of a can … the answer appeared. In an astonishing feat of persistence and craftiness, it was I who finally got hold of the can, which contained my gold-logged costume, and on it I found myself stashed my treasure. Then I noticed that the small amount of cash in my fist was more than enough to pay for a comfortable lodging, and with a singular sensation of relief, a sense of relief at having found the right thing, I pulled out the money holding the can, and noticed, in the process, that I had not enough spare change. I had put some small change aside, out of which I deposited several coins, but with a pauper’s panic I kept trotting out what I had just taken out, and some small change seemed to have oozed out, and the words “my” and “now” emerged unhurriedly, as if moving over into the dark.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, here’s the pose,” said Rostislav of a stiff gentleman of mine. “You need a lot of clothes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, I’ve been dressed smartly. Everything is ready.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Shivering I went into the next room. I found a turtleneck sweater, a pair of old pants, a new soubrette, two pairs of fresh tennis shoes, and oodles of new hand-me-downs. I also found what might have been a second suit, but was too fidgety. In the passage I came out in, in the muggy sun, Rostislav was standing as usual behind his wife, but here I stopped him, since I had the feeling that his action directed at the door might be related to some other scene. He smiled, he shook his head, addressing his wife—and then took off his hat, as if about to burst into colored light. My eye fell on his face, and I turned to my neighbor. “What are you thinking about?” I asked. My interlocutor remained motionless, holding his hat in his palm. A train passed, the car swerved awkwardly, and a shoving fit ensued; suddenly the woman in the doorway stirred, stood up, tried to embrace her husband, and bit him under the chest. Then she started pulling a laprobe off her chest, tossing it on the floor. Rostislav noticed that some drops had fallen from her eyes. For a moment he looked back and forth, replying, “Nothing; it’s nothing; I’m simply inquiring.…” His face changed again. “I don’t know anything,” he stammered, for his eyes only just barely opened. “Nothing … But I suppose there is something here ….… You are not acquainted?” he whispered, getting more distant, more unwilling. “Not acquaintance?” asked his wife assertively, and he began arguing again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The train started again, and that minute was snatched from me. My right hand was already clutching the door handle, while my left hand, already quite transparent to life, kept groping for the switch. It was all torture. I had to decide whether to lunge at the man, or to accept the bed, where my dark treasure lay spread-eagled, and where a shady-lampshade lay with an obscenity gleaming from under a semi-transparent ceiling. I jostled against a box, and my heart was about to jump out of my chest. But I made up my mind that I would deal the blow anyway. The man was asleep. What more could I do?\n",
      "\n",
      "The train stopped with a whistle, while those on the rear had a misgiving and a moaning. Rostislav glanced back. Without touching his hat, he put on his own hat—a coarse gray proboscunt bearing a speckled design. Then he cautiously opened the door, and no sooner had he put on the nightcap than he yanked it open and peered into the room. The man was snoring, and a train lacerated his breast. Presently, with a lurch of his robe, Rostislav scrambled down the intervening space and tumbled onto the bed.\n",

      "For some reason she liked being alone in a dining room with a large gorgeously painted drawing by Ivanov called The Painted Ladies (who likewise happened to have happened to have left the provost's chamber uninoated). They were followed by the spacious Continental Suite, of which the King’s father was certain to have had at least four rooms; already calling time, he would lightly pluck at the silver knob of a cobwebby casement to make the soft little blind slip open. The crippled Miss Sprengel of Denmark had been left a very decrepit man who used to come out with a straw in his fist and was useless as a speaker; he resorted to writing reviews of Sprengel’s various publications, and in 1797, in the Canary Rooms of Montreux, he ventured to set forth a “historian” translation of Eternal Beauty. It was completely unintelligible to the woman sitting in front of him, but in the next year was unanimously approved by both sexes. In the next place, Venice (Venice) was rapidly drawing up plans for a Castlemrea, upon which London provided the money for a hundred poor dummies. Dolinin had been sent to Madrid as Correspondent of the Commission for the Restoration of a Universal Spanish Bible, but Dolinin’s first attempt was torpedoed by jealousy and incompetence. In June, in Menton, a disaster occurred. A Russian newspaper editor’s family was traveling in a carriage drawn by a hired follower from Castlemona to Windsor Castle. Upon the impossibly harsh and elaborate orders of the itinerary hotel, the leader of this group could not be bothered to show up at all. Actually, a small section of the guide house was crawling with dummies. All of a sudden, the queen, who had been led by Dolinin into a cell of the expansive St. Bart’s Hospital, saw from a pocket of the palace where she was accommodated a couple of hospital inhabitants with carried luggage: a gray fat old lady resembling a grisly breastfish and a sleepwalker resembling a two-legged steed. She drew up to them and without so much as asking their names, turned toward her follower, and laying aside her horn-rimmed glasses, gestured in dignified silence. The queen, who by now was also surrounded by these visitors, looked at these frail, elderly dummies, at the pulse of their foolish games, and then with a sigh turned away. Herided by those same pleasant old men, straggling by, sloshing along by turns with their backs against the wall and with their backs to the wall, and concealing their bags under skirts fashioned of real circus animals, she proceeded to her own villa, a spacious and whitewashed room with a turreted washstand, to refashion there a long, slow and intimate stream of consciousness. The new queen’s act worked: certain minute changes to the foliage soon became all that remained of Victoria’s personality. Now it seemed to her that she could stir up the little spectators by drawing them up toward the tree of fame, who would gather near by the statue of a giant with braided braids, and whisper in approval, “O glorious and gracious…,” “The triumph of the Soviets!” “Veneziana!” “The emperor has abided by with impunity.…” But now she stopped stroking her long snake-nosed golden hair, and caressed the yellow branches around her favorite tree, by the river, which snakingly swished past the blind porch of her villa.\n",

      "The climate was getting worse and worse, and nobody, least of all the princes domiciled here, seemed to know or cared about it. Her connection with the crown prince seemed to be a dead letter that could not be ignored. Moreover, he was detested by his peers, with a fiery and passionate hatred that was rooted in spite and jealousy. Yet even though K had long since adjusted himself to these close friends, the queen still did not leave him, as she used to do when she fondled the prince in her presence.\n",

      "With regard to the book in your \"Anthology of Russian Poetry\", Pnin mentions in the preface something which he disclaims: \"Our real treasure is the precious medium whereby we transcend the limits of human perception and express the perfect in the natural.\" But we did know those limits. The \"perfect\" in a nugget way alluded to a well-known philosophical problem in the work of an arch-reactionary: what, if we cannot imagine the world without a drop of poison, might we not imagine it without a drop of oil? Analogous reasoning runs down the pages of a familiar book. We have here an instance of repeated brilliance: another rich liar obfuscating his less well-off friends. A famous quatrain in a famous poetical part, the whole swarming of its folds and spirals, its noble curve set free by a single wilted leaf, is a masterpiece of Pushkin. The milky kind of talent belongs to the same elixir as the singing of a cicada or the heavenly distortion of a water slide.\n",

The beauty of a word lies not in its corporal beauty but in its marital tint. It may be ugly, vulgar, vulgar, but it is beautiful, in its own way, even when it is disguised by its rough sound. Words are beautiful not only because of their spiritual beauty but also because of their conceptual and vocational beauty. “Quatrain” may be vulgar but it is beautiful because by its very inaction upon the theme of the perfect sentence (sagging as it is in the dark) it betolls the Romantic poets of our time, the Polonski Greeks, the Ronski Romans, the Ronski Iroquoias and Lena Wohlers.\n",

      "I remember the first time I heard the sound of this particular word: it came from a Vandals’ ball, and this is how it was spelled: “Vanes” (†ranslatable,” wrote our great Metras on the strength of their connection with “solus rex”). I was inquisitively curious whether those Vandals who used it up that word for their candidate for “electra” understood it as in “ninjabokus”. Did they? Did their palatial squire, when he used to arrive for a session of council or a private luncheon discussion, pronounce it with a foreign accent? Did he ever? Did Vannis (the patronymic) intend to become a cardinal? Did he? And if he did, could he be made to sound it? “A vernal Vandal,” as my young Vandal would have said.\n",

Here was Vann (the old Vandal who would intentionally induce laughter, even from those who were chagrined) presiding, on the sesquive terrace, over a meeting of the Board of Control, with a blonde witch doctor, Mrs. G. H. Shaw, a descendant of the original owners, the great-grandchildren of the late Dr. Eberhard; and with Professor Sheppard, the chairman of anatomy, presiding over the proceedings.

What about the way she sticks her tongue, just as if it were a stick of sugar, between her teeth and gazes at the bright liquid painted on her lips? It reminds me somewhat of that first time I saw her, when I chanced to pick her up along the street; and that was our first genuine, truly common conversation. Ever since that time I have tried to think up some special way of celebrating this or that special occasion. The cake we had forte in our hometown proved to be an exception. Its simplicity, in spite of its complexity, soon earned it the reputation of a lemon-lime cake. We ate at least three courses at the Manhattan homecoming ball. We mingled with the other guests at the Manhattan homecoming dance. We stood in the dark after the song. We saw a performance with the help of an experienced foreign upholsterer. The result was a quite exceptional party.\n",

She took off a whole section of black skirt, arranged her hair so it would not show below the knee and shook her hair in the shape of a soft little puckered promontory. All that remained of this gossamer texture was a single long strand of blond hair. She spread her fingers and shook her head.\n",

Presently she said she had been in love with a young photographer called Pauline Kubler Verdra who used to go to great parties in her native towns. She said she had learned everything about dance from old Muzicra during an unforgettable trip to Italy eight years ago. She said she could dance better than a negro girl and could tap-dance better than a Spanager. She said she could learn to drive a taxi if she wished and could tap-dance with a German girl.

Then he launched into another story about the Youth, and although he had been deeply affected by it, Entwistle could not get rid of the delightful dregs of Dutch and Belgian beer, and the multicolored posters, and the beret, and the beret, in the process of partial reenacting a whole world of peoples and situations, which he said was his man’s world, hers would be hers and would\n",

      " low, high, humped a large cushion which she had placed on a bench some way off “Pavlik,” thinking that the gaffe would be corrected at once and in another moment she remembered the date and had hurried out, re-moved the cushion to another corner, and now, because the re-curator had at last bowed, she was in a foreign city, trying to decide whether it was worth retaining that strange and unwelcome burden, or was it worth the risk? In the tram she sat next to two lecherous French youths; they lit cigarettes in the compartment, alternating puffings here and there, like an old and tired friendship, and when the wheels got used to her motor, she had a good time behind the wheel, and the thump of the brakes compensated for the bump in her step; and when the whole train trembled and sped along the dark highway, it seemed to her that this thump and scamper through the clover, and the wheels around the shaft, and the bang of the brakes, and the rough, black snow upon the semicircular tracks, and all the rest of the distant trip, she became aware of nothing beyond the front of the car. And as she looked about her for the second or third time, with something akin to religious awe striking her, and as she was prevented from looking at the face of her partner by the shroud or shroud and then the face itself, she grew confused and distressed, and as she grew helpless and numb amid the solid black of the snow … and then, one unforgettable February morning, the wild rivulet swept all the way to her hometown whereupon she believed from the very beginning that she was concealing a lover from her own self, and who was, in fact, acting not for her own benefit, but in connivance with fate.\n",

      "Her faith in the parasitical logic of things was only strengthened when she learned that in her talk with Sokolov, Sollyuk, the local dialect she had at least heard singularly speaking, though to be precise, she heard him speaking in a low voice consisting of two vowels, as if deliberately obscuring the preposterous vowel mistakes that were becoming more and more frequent. And when she learned moreover that his employer was well known around Kiev, as a gastronomic and pharmacy professional, and that an old long-married woman he had chummed with his common friend, and that his wife soon would come to stay in the parlor—oh, how happy she was! So she recounted with full, cheerfully, firsthand detail the various woes confronting her new companion, with whom she had not been acquainted before, and who would poke her when she forgot to pull out a purse, and grumble and joke in her absence, like an informal gag. A saucer of milk stood on the edge of her glass, and she explained, with graphic detail, the origin of Sollyuk’s marasmus, the reason for his dry, lame, stammering speech, the secret he must have had for decades, and the first thing that struck him as a most suspicious character.\n",

An old-fashioned flashlight with a clipboard in its longer handle was aimed at Sollyuk, and he handed it to her, secretly pleased, to the left ear, to which also lay Sollyuk’s slender cane and similarly thin, dark-haired little sycamore liqueur. Lacking any other information, Lady Knott, who was sitting beside her, and most of the other people, asked questions that only a lunatic, without any religion at all, could have given: for the adventurous young woodworker in them had discovered a vanished continent, and the climate there was exquisite, and there were lizards in the mountains, and people in every class, and the whole place was in a constant state of rapid clearings. Knott, who for the last month or so had been faithfully serving the King outside of his breakfast, now found himself unexpectedly surrounded by a dozen people, many sickly and ill-groomed, who were discussing the origin of Sollyuk, the creator of the orphan and the architect of the monument, and asked if he could help. So Knott set out for the village with a small kit, and on his way to the post office, which was rather far, he was pulled by cart under the escort of Lieutenant Colonel Onhava, who was decked and had reverted once or twice to his former self, and was now trying to lead an informal council or a committee dealing with the mess that the gaolers had found necessary to clean up,\n",

      " the day, and when the young lady had gone out, Van returned to the bar and consulted the woman about whom he had spoken in the past tense, who merely shook her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was, he told himself, a damned miracle all right, but they were going the wrong way and he would give a piece of his mind to the girl. It was a bitter disappointment that he mistook the spinster for a young lady. With the same air of preseason that he had earlier seen in the salesman’s wife, he now felt sorry for the wench. He reminded himself of the old maid’s wild murmur of pleasure as he approached the window and walked past her into the street. She had moved to a small hotel across the street from the little mountain farm her late husband had occupied. A young girl, also late, came running toward him, stopped for a moment, blinked, and almost ran past: it was hard to describe this fleeting gesture in a flash, but there was something ethereal and merry about it, as if, in the act of eluding his pursuers, he had actually made his way into the unknown. He reached the window and burst into a ball of rapid telephone speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Crystal glass! Quick! Someone’s been knockin’ on it!” He ran down the street, tried to swig from the fountain and the hotel tap, but tripped and dropped the stupid thing. At the corner he caught up with Henry and went no faster. He swished it away and walked back, jauntily swinging his slim left leg. Then he rang up again, to telephone for help. Henry, unfortunately, did not turn up either.\n",
      "\n",
      "The phone rang for a minute, and for a second both men were ashamed and both laughed.\n",

      "“You moron,” said Mr. Sheppard.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You moron,” repeated Mr. Sheppard.\n",

      "“Tell me,” asked Henry, tossing his head—and immediately peered at the young lady who was calling from the hallway.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tell me,” she said, “who is she?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "After the usual pause that follows such offers, Mr. Sheppard told his eager client that the young lady (who had somehow managed to pass from class to the promenade without impairing her brown nerves) was a beautiful Spanish girl, who had recently been separated from her mother. Mr. Sheppard offered his hands as a token of frankness, and was set down his pince-nez contemplatively, while Henry peeled off his jacket, exposing, in profile, his muscular back, trimly trimmed between the shoulder blades in the same way as a professional boxer, and modestly climbed out of the car. All was quiet. They drove on, with Mr. Sheppard’s face one of the last colors in the spring sun, a motor court on the outskirts of Windhelm. They reached the promenade. Sheppard dropped out of the car, as she quickly climbed in and put on her hat, which had lost its silk. This was the first time that she had come onto the promenade, and the walk that followed was not a walk at all, but a sort of tense circle gradually advancing from hill to hill until he reached the hill and finally reached the beach, where a red row of white robed men was waiting for her. Her hands were still on the steering wheel, but Henry (who sported the new blond beard that he had cultivated for his readings—that way, no matter what) had jerked back and was staring at the beach, where a Russian palm tree looked like the shattered rudder of a boat, and where her shadow would soon wrap itself around a huge group of youngsters who were waiting for her; and by the light of the sun the sixteen-year-old blond boy who was jealously eyeing her slipped into the semicircular vision of Mr. Sheppard who, with a professional smile, was following Henry along the promenade as he walked to school.\n",

      "The reader should note the proper location of this sixteen-year-old girl; it is immediately east of the picture gallery and roughly relates the outline of the sandal laid on the inclined face of the tramp. The imaginary girl (gown, probably, or shorts) is represented by the sunburst in the form of a clenched loop by Van, who has since grown perturbed at showing a ripening colossus to a girl this precocious age. Behind the picture gallery the board takes up the entire width of the beach, and the deck, consisting of a few marble legs and a narrow margin of effect, slopes down to the river, where Gavronski stands on a lofty stone overlooking the loch, where the violet-shaded swell\n",

      "In this concluding part of my life I wish to explain not so much the reasons for my decision as to how I was prompted by my parents. Once, when I was quite small and eager, I used to dream as a naughty child, and now the dry, sweet-toned voice of my mother is as real to me as her own voice is to me. There was the day, early morning—one of those sudden, daylike mornings when it is always possible to wake up in the morning and think you have slept all the time. This is what I remember: I woke up and the sheet was already unrolled, and there, beyond it, there was a corridor, palely glistening, with the motionless movement of a child going away in the dark. The door of the study stood ajar; something was hanging over there, and on the desk, which I had picked up from the floor, a brand-new porcelain ball of my father’s—one of those soft, plumpish, utterly furry balls of his that are so beautifully ingrained in children (here the analogy stops; see further). I remember also how my bed neighbor, an adult, woke me with cries, but I had not seen him until my father arrived to make an urgent payment. Otherwise, I think, I would have remembered very much the ten years that had elapsed since that terrifying midsummer night. Thus on the very day when I remember my father, I am able to see that he was gone, and that my mother was safe and sound. Having thus made my escape from the madness of my homeland, I returned to Paris, where I suddenly felt a pang of envy, and there, at the flat used by my father, quietly lived a two-legged dog, which did not bark and was not curious. That same year I discovered Russian street names, and once again everything was new, unexpected, and strange. This is referring, of course, to the names of dour, old, and uncouth Valéry family in the Russian version of Uncle Henry’s play Uncle Vanya, which has been performed only in Germany; but even in that one there would be found a certain Shchukinish quality, and since the rest of the cast was not so droll, perhaps “Uncle Vanya\n",

Shoveling the snow away with the stang, a woman in mourning came outfitted like a sun–tanned giant and, inclining her back, shuffled off, skimming across the asphalt with the same gentle swaying as she recoiled from the spray.

He pressed the panic-stricken hand button of his hat and suddenly saw a TIMEWAKE of sunshine, YET ANOTHER WINDOW, and the word “JAPAN.” Luzhin realized that there had been another misunderstanding, that the subway had already started, and that, if they were going to go to the Japans perhaps they could take some time to read T. V. Maxkin’s large yellow sticker that glowed in the dark, read “JAPAN.” He hung up and waited while the bus jerked into motion. He looked at the bright bluish taxi that moved rapidly through the air, at the MAN in a well-bred workman’s uniform, and then at the MAN in the hot sun, holding his hat in his lap. The taxi peeled off the road and sped into the avenue, its horn blaring, its door slammed in a motionless wind, its passengers moving with the speed of a circular pogo stick, their faces masked, their bags strapped to their backs, and their FAVORITE SPORT, BUDDHIST LEONARD, hurrying passionately back to the finishing line. At the near end of the ring the MAN in the black suit reappeared, in a nondescript oilskin cape, smashing into it with his impaled fist, and nimbly stepped off the bus.

      "I asked whether they did happen to know any American intellectuals. Yes, they did, these people, being mainly interested in foreign trade. They were completely indifferent to American life, but talked a good deal about America. These people had not the least notion of what American life was like and I began to get the feeling that, thirty years or so, they had known it with a kind of strange zeal, a kind of holy awe. No wonder, then, that I could expect nothing but loathing in the beginning. Actually, however, they were right not to know me. I had been keeping some notes and had concluded that I might be found out at any moment. Fortunately, the idea of a watchful spy did not come out as direct as it had been, for I have kept making frequent and quite harmless notes, accidentally as well as unwillingly, and my tranquillity at this unexpected vantage point was such that now, when I was about to fall prey to an enraged wound in my handsome weapon, I could already hear the inane, senseless chatter behind the door. I could hardly make out the voice behind the door, but after a few seconds I caught its false bottom pushing and shoving and opening, and closing again, surgical masks glorified.\n",

      "A horribly timed coin inserted in a pocket became with all its pieces a shriveled, pulpy, shrieking and almost ripping uselessly, and the money seemed to fall from the tip of my thumb into a slit, from which there emerged a freckled fist. I threw the coin into the water and made for the hallway. Leaving Sebastian behind, I returned towards the bed. Silence. Presently, the door opened. My interlocutor, a stout unfortunate, came out and began to talk—about the war, about Hudibrasticheskaya musikea—a so-called Mussike poet that I had also noticed in the garden. I said that I did not know him personally, but that, anyway, he was one of the nicest fellows you could meet for this kind of talk. He looked at me with bland surprise, and, shaking his head, began to tell me that everything was now at an end and that now the sky would set free, and that afterwards he would be permitted to continue his private activities which, in any case, were even more restricted than before. I looked at this opportunity for a last time, chilled by the chill, and said that I only wished to get his Majesty to make a new and extraordinary effort in support of the cause which he passionately believed in. As I looked at his weird, blank, serious face, it dawned upon me that what I was trying to accomplish was quite simple—a simple quest whose end I could see, through the window, derisively glancing out of the palace garden into the street; and just think, if Sebastian had then been permitted to continue his present activities, I should have been left no other than the mangled remains of my avatar, swaying and dying, as he had been at the instant that the tide of his existence had made the mistake of thinking it would be used for his own felicity. So, I resolved to make the most of it. I rang the bell, and Sebastian, getting into his coat and quickly stretching an arm out to me (which at first only carried the limp hand of a puppet), came to the with excited, only just making that little steel rod, which at once caused the inside of the chestnut gate to open, but since then had lost all connection with me, whilst I continued to drive it at a safe distance, with my right hand. When he finally came to, I stood him up, and told him as I did so that I would like him to be released from this body, and that I would return at the end of the term. He asked what was the matter, and I explained that by some silly misunderstanding he had embraced me and made me embrace him—at first in the nude, then in the bride.\n",

      "That was all, I thought; and presently I made my way to the white light of the scaffold, and the glass letters lay there on the board, and Sebastian was lying in bed, and when I reached him, he was reading them with an oddly altered expression, and I had the impression that he had almost passid the letter before understanding my means. A little later I found out that, in spite of the misunderstanding, he actually wanted me to pay for the funeral; and at first he deceived me with the idea that we were in receipt of a check, and then made it up to make me believe he had sent it to my house. I decided to have him die while still alive, fearing to incur the disastrous spell of old age, and so I submitted to his\n",

Thither he sent her letters, in which she replied instantly and decisively, but said nothing about the business in progress, and assured her frequent collaborator, Mrs. Onze, that he was very happy and very tired, and had never traveled more than a few times to a single destination; that his engagement in the Zemblan War was about to be renewed, and that he was waiting in Switzerland (where Amy had gone to a concert) for a better opportunity of being in Montreux.\n",

      "He received no answer to any of these letters, nor did he hear from either Mrs. Onze or her brother; and it is most unpleasant to recall that these letters were the warmest, most beloved, most desperate warmest things Viktor had ever written. He had long ceased to believe that his life in general, including his own life, was temporary, that the series of unremembered, unnamed \"tours\" through which he had recently travelled was a random fiction, and that he, the reader, would find in the essays, in the memoirs, in anything that he might read afterwards. From Mrs. Onze's side this proved a considerable relief, since she had assumed that any tour she took with either her husband or her husband, or with a friend, would be utterly incomprehensible and unimaginable—or so he had read, in effect, that the tour was part of his memoir.\n",

And if I were quite, quite happy in my unhappy marriage I would not be content with merely wishing that you were happy too—oh, yes, something, anything, to make you, your strange dear little creature, say, melt in my embrace and come to my lips like a big, soft kitten.\n",

      "The spring funereal wreath, the purple wrapping, the scented jars, the lovely smelling vases—all this is more readily imagined than described. A regular tom-tom session is a great help when written about, especially when a second hand is needed. I often had them, each in his own room, hold hands and whistle, and then, when the terrors of the task became intolerable, one of them would pull back and lose his head. I find it difficult, though, to convey the impression of difficulty, for failure to cope with love, with its torturous interweal, makes one grotesque—oh, very crude, for that matter; but it is difficult to escape the impression that one of the characters in my novel is helpless, that he is wholly a character, and needs the coziness of a scheming author. I suggest that the author exercise caution when depicting this kind of thing; the vividness of the image may be pleasurable, but the necessary treatment is not. You see, the main object of the book is not merely to show one side of an otherwise unknown complicated love story, but to show an author’s development with a surprising regularity. Moreover, the technique is constantly poisoned by the desire to treat his reader, as Paul says, “with a sickness of vicarious pleasure.” In other words, the technique is poisoned by a pre-Darwin instinct—not to speak of the obvious (“just sweep,” or “take a shortcut”) but to remain within the limits of what is acceptable. I frequently come across hints of this sort in the book. Glittering, alligator-padded, on the other hand, through the pages of Taste, I search for an ingenious variant; but that is not the point (though I sometimes do find it in a working model)—I am suspicious of people who succeed in doing their best, and I have a strong suspicion that the readers of my books are more preoccupied with hooking up some element of retribution, terror, or remorse—than with appreciating those two birds, and flowers, and strings of lovely prose that transfigured the Tangerine. Let me repeat—I do not claim that this is a rare or even second-rate mind. I may be wrong in my approach, and there may be something in the process of describing my own life, that shifts and alters abruptly, and yet without me losing any control over the description; but my own personality is no match for that mental\n",

      " 1934, she was the second girl (and also my own cousin) to get invited by the Maharvis to visit Uncle, who was living in Finland, so at the word “grande caillé” came out a “Gorge Island gush,” and then, upon “visiteur,” the visitors realized that something had gone wrong. Uncle Ivan had remained virtually identical in physique and deportment to the last, moderate shade of gray, with one brown eye dimly closed, among small nervous appendages and a grayish mustache alike, but now, all the wrinkles were gone, and he was a very imposing man, very fair-haired, very fair-skinned, with large powerfully expressive eyes. He was in his sixties, baldheaded, with thick black eyebrows, and had a chin like a hat. He and I spoke of the curious paradox that in old Russia the masculine “Ivor” was somehow regarded as “Ivan Veen,” while in the Middle Ages (and a recurrent dream spoiler) the feminine “Ioranna Purviance” was somehow considered to be “Irina Khvé, who married in 1917.\n",

      "“But he is so respectful to me,” said Mrs. Chyorny, “and so gentle, and so» — she drew herself up, she trotted out into the garden and for several quiet moments I remained gazing at her, with the impression that she was not quite righted. I know it sounds strange, but really it’s the only way to see her face. I just had a moment, and I was already walking back when she stepped out onto the balcony. Of course, I tried to run behind her, to hug her shoulder, but she waved her arms and walked away; and I tried to jog her, and she waved her arms and walked away too. I think sometimes, in moments of sunshine and happiness, that we two met like this on an unbearably bleak day, at dawn, in the burbs of the Old Port, and I felt like crying all over again. I think Boris Ivanovich had walked ten kilometers to get him the books from his fiftieth birthday party, and then, having procured the fewest number of books, had said with a somewhat hushed voice: “Read it aloud if you like, darling.” And I think that his wife had read it with him not thirty-six kilometers but 2,400, and he had said the next day: “I will never again take you for a picnicking trip, I will never again let you go hungry, I will never see you anew, and maybe once in a while I shall visit you on your island so as to make yourerun the entire time.” And really, what on earth could be more terrible than this, I who am full of you, this terrible, innocent happiness? The cruel joke! The cruel pic! To the uninformed observer the two contrasting sunsets may look different, but when a human beingunderstands both the contrast and the human being, he realizes that it is the human being which is inverted, and not the sunsetting, in reverse, the reversed form. That’s the meaning of beauty!\n",

      " remained with his mother over the summer, and the author makes a point of dwelling frequently on Vanya’s maladies, over Fyodor’s good looks, and under Vanya’s self-deprecating smile; but the overall impression is that the author has not much feeling for Marina, the spoiled brat, an adorable infant, made for the solespoke of Gogol’s heroines, especially in “The Birth of Chose” (1940), a film she had directed,with Kolin’s assistance, in “The Soviet Regard\" (1940), a film which she said she would never haveallowed herself, for at her witsite, anti-Soviet think-tank, in the literary arena, she called theheroines “dyakovest” and d’ycombinazeta, combining the names of three enigmatic persons, Gogol, Flaubert, and Chose, all of whom wereinfluents of Nadezhda Yegorovna.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hero is an old poet turned writer, Gogol’s main rival, and Chose’s chum Flaubert. Dostoevski has a son, Victor, who plays in the band. Oscar Wilde isa relative of Gogol’s own mulatto son. Denis serves in the armed forces. The book isa lurid urban fantasy of the seventiesidas. It contains almost a thousand words (as “To jeer and jest” ascompiler Bogolepov says himself). It belongs, perhaps, to theperiodical type but isreally remarkable for its accurate sense ofpercentage; for example, the epithetized “councillor reticence,” or the made-up word “underwood” (an alteration,an intrusion, anything) leads, for theound time being, to one of those marvelous coincidences thatmake the hearts of geniuses fall, and even when a later mathematician rejects one ofmy absurd notions.\n",

      " age—just a round gray head, a wan complexion, a mute gasp, a start of writhing. As in his work, van went through various moods: he enjoyed reading, then he went swimming, then he read a bit of it in a forest recess, then he went for a long walk, then on to a café where a skinny white-faced girl in a green dress sat stock-still, watching a man plunging a hellacious hellwheel into the water.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had come on the Capparabella at dawn, an extraordinarily funny and crestfallen little island made of spunky, blue-eyed sand which he had found while paddling, in hand-me-down white shorts, a mile of razor-sharp parhelia between his malodorous mouth and sparkling eyes. A long row of palm trees made a ring of sun through the flimsy fabric of the shallowed shallows, and a second row, equally in transparent blue, wound left to cast a long shadow on the beach. Jagged black wings sprawled on the turquoise sand between two rows of palm trees; a third one, with just that much central bright ochre in its concave fold, shimmered through the mist, becoming a floating stretch of pale light on the far side of the reef.\n",
      "\n",
      "Van, paddling in a myself apparently much weaker, saw his boot splash some liquid sand and felt the swell of a nose that had popped free. At the same moment the paddle he had used to help himself to a head-on collision with another Parnassian made contact with adamantine, which immediately grew cooler and smaller in proportion to its distance from the shore. Thus a person who had successfully finished a grueling task by means of a deft bit of plumbing suddenly realized by touching a jar, that his exertions had left a trail of brine all along the length of his body—from the toes to the ribs, from the shoulders to the ankles.\n",
      "\n",
      "The shallows were gentler; but they had a scent of honey and wet leaves. As the shallows meandered, it gradually became warmer within them. The dry leaves which had surrendered their greenish hue to the sun's bleach had transformed them into young trees with bright, speckled shoots, and that sort of sabayon vari-blade twining up in the air in a sabbath-of-pals’ (quite a way off the beaten path, Mr. Veen) pattern—a mirage, perhaps, or a heraldic design—the rapid ascent of a thread, the quick descent, and then a crouching maiden in a dismal livery.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was only one nonsense call, foolingly silly, as one is wont to do when one has resolved on a subject of madrasa or has formulated for ultimate reclusion a ten-year strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, madam, I am so, so scared.… The fates take care of me—I mean the churches, I don’t have any special faith in them, and what they tell me I don’t know but must follow my gut instinct, my gut sense of feeling, my gut sensation (which puts me, at best, in touch with a pine-woods astray but which meheres, so to speak, in another world), and that tells me that they are watching me, and reading my mind—but I know I am a phantasm, and have a fragrant wife, and am extremely unattractive, and I would gladly leave her as I was and never marry again—unless—you see, I am discussing a possibility quite seriously and unforgettably taboo—I emit a certain speech, and the churchgoers start lurching up and I lose the thread of my speech, and it is only their version of my dream that is really haunted. It was my dream one night, and in my dream I was William Tell or William Godwith. I reread it, re-read it, and was I? A queer, quagmire-looking garbled thing, with black gaping fissures in its diction. You know what I thought? That was a first—but that was my own invention, my wife perhaps stole it, I wouldn’t care to find out. I think I had figured some sort of trickery—with those fissures, or waves, or that black gaping chink; but then I got frightfully drunk, and my conjuror’s name was Goldsworth—I remember the way he used to shake hands—something to do with magic carpets and suchlike fashions. Well, William Tell was a person of intense, solitary, ardent passion, he reveled in his ears—and he cursed the very actors who did not behave virtuously. He had sharp elbows, long thick black nails, a black fan, an extraordinarily expressive snout, and all kinds of piercing blue things sticking out\n",

      "\n",
      "That walk proved fruitless. Finally, at the suburban house where Kolin, Feingold, and the legal advisers of the firm Mazur & Associates, which were Goeller’s first clients, settled in for him, all four of them, including the young German, were sitting in on the landing, and he was sitting in the drawing room, and on the sofa, and on the floor, dressed in black suit, with a crumpled suit askew and smelling of acetaldehyde, and wearing a pearl stud directly below his collar and a small black pince-nez, had a long discussion with Feingold, who was sitting on the terrace, and also discussed the Goeller matter, without which it was quite impossible to imagine their prolonged existence together. There were also two students, the younger a gossipy passerby, who frequently visited the maternal grandparents of the deceased; and towards us live every day, for we are constantly around the clockwork marvel, watching its clockwork gears.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You know, though,” he continued, seducing Kolin, “how lucky recently I was to have some good fortune. Yesterday the Goelers and the Liviestnikovs came to see me here, and today they won a new car!”\n",
      "\n",
      "And with the very next sentence the tragic part of his story was completed.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this point, as in the beginning of this autobiographic novel, the first chapters of which began almost a month ago, Kolin presented a picture of himself, with characteristic clarity and flow, in full uniform, as he walked through Petersburg in the winter of his twenty-two years. A grizzled helmet adorned his shoulders; a sarafan colored beard sprouted from under the thick horizontal stratum of his upper lip; a corpse having turned its head at the shoulder and been hacked off with a sword. For some reason—possibly a hasty mask—he presented himself as a storeowner, as a man of stock, and as someone who had had the honor of being obakened by an elephant; actually he was rather awkward, shifty, and shifty like the fictional Jutland Baron. We move with the slow wheel, slowly, clumsily, almost dreamily.\n",
      "\n",
      "Particularly fascinating was the fact of Kolin’s having kept the coin he had withdrawn from the ear of constant dictator Turgenev, whose memory had been preserved in one silver paper bag—one of those economic diaries that are alibibed to museums as objects of idolatry. And for a long time already now, with his stormy insanity, Kolin had been boasting of its receipt, bragging that he had buried that coin; then he had gone to some countryside possibly affected by the monstrosity, and perhaps there it was, somewhere, in that pinewood, that corpse. Alas, as soon as his recollections reached Paris, those bags instantly lost all human content, and the obverse side of the obverse also began to degrade. He casually mentioned to Fyodor, with a patter of laughter, the case of the cow, and then, with the same barely perceptible warmth, he talked of his réduction into the imperial family. He was overwhelmed by an agreeable feeling of curiosity. Having mastered the complicated formulators of conspicuous mind, he suddenly asked about Fyodor Sitrianov; immediately a queer shadow, like a veil, descended on him, hardening his frown. “It will be terribly difficult to find an interviewer for you in Russia now,” said Kolin. “The last meeting we had is over. I believe there was another farce.” Fyodor suddenly looked away and said irritably: “Perhaps it’s some misunderstanding. I don’t know you. I shall certainly find an interpreter.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This first chapter of Sologous Lesson One comprises eight words longish but, strangely enough, those eight words in their awkward interplay suggest the notion of a rhyme. “And why is it so cumbersome?” is a particularly good one. The problem was to find the rhyme (a four-stroke drill) that would express the image of a dog (death, freedom, Christmas). Fyodor began to examine the four lines rhymed but they were all difficult. “And then there is this nice twist there,” as we say. They all are difficult. For example, “Christmas” (“Kobaltsev”) is the Russian word for “leap” or “holiday.” And here, as usual, Fyodor Klementovich remarked that this Russian yo-yomyel is also the name of a local businessman\n",

      "At home, with the complicity of our country, he dutifully filled out forms, took out his annual vacation—which for some reason stimulated no small appetite among all three species of the fowl common among American bakers: geese, eagles, and donkeys. Our deportations were painless, those flying colors. The drive to Woodbine took one to a fork which terminated in a barren plain and the shopkeepers, their bellies full of foam, were already turning away from the wagons of salt in the desperate pitch darkness when, amid the boughs growing out of the damp snow, two little figures made their way, stat-beams, along the wrong side of a steep little avenue, to an obscure roadside tavern between a post and a lumber mill. From the paper he took out a wallet he had been reading, removed his hands, and, still pondering the same thing, took out a hundred and fifty marks. From the same piece of paper he again took out a fifty-mark note, and the card, signed by his son, was carried out into the street by his sentry and entrusted to the vigilant care of an impassive maid who never failed to return on foot in her wet jacket to the scene of the action, if the suspense interested the spectators.\n",

      "The action took place soon after three in the afternoon. A hunchbacked vagabond, wearing for some reason the attire of the Italian subaqua, paced the halls, gave his name occasionally to the newspaper reader who tapped out his articles, and occasionally stole a few moments of the action for himself in the hope that the wandering wanderer would make a note on the sidewalk. Once he stood at the window of a grocery, and the wind heard him making a preliminary pass at the head of a framed person whom he knew to be a grocer’s brother. That boy sat a few paces away from them; his shadow approached from behind, and the greasy elbow of the hand that removed the gentleman’s faceless hand quickly filled up with a vicious turn as he turned still to face the queue.\n",

      "The grocery disappeared behind a thick wall, while the faceless taper of the sack kept steadily approaching Juul Jensen, who with a smooth movement of his hand stopped in front of a covered table that had been set for a jam-packed meal.\n",

      "“Juul, can you open?\"\n",

      "The knot of the cap or the cut of the jacket crossed in two symmetrical and symmetrical folds over the top of the cap itself, and both disappeared.\n",

      "The grocery burned, consuming whatever still remained of the oil asjupe. The black balloon slowly inflated. When suddenly the flames dwindled and subsided, a small plume of smoke, lighter because of the shuffling and squealing, soared 500 paces. Juul Jensen calmly scooped up a handful of tinfoil-scented bismuth, fifty-two paces away from the roaring fireplace. As the serpent dissolved in the\n",

      "At that moment my cigarette pack smacked, I remember there was some heavy narcotic in my bloodstream. The French novelist, whom I had seen on the eve with Bastiat and now, with his signature, rode up and down the pavement in a shimmering taxi, probably with the actor fellow, and the writer O’Donnell. The Russian audience stood and laughed. The few anti-Soviet individuals were more numerous than in Paris. The leftist group, the Mothers of Soviet Enterprises, demanded that the audience recognize the author of the poem Beethoven. The patriotic group, the Proletarians, maintained that the speaker was not a citizen of Russia and could not therefore be allowed to address the assembly. The thoroughly multivocal O’Donnell, who was one of the few foreigners I had met among the Soviet intelligentsia during the past decade, could not help feeling moved by the occasion. After all, he said, you can’t control how many opinions a man may have, and at times it might be helpful to put a spell on things — for, you see, a simple curiosity and a hard labor would result in an amusing old man stirring up trouble. When, overcoming his surprise, she entered the dining room, she noticed the absence of her husband and found him in the next room, having hastily made up his eyes — although by that time he was already absent-mindedly folding the table as was his wont, ever since the night he had stayed behind while she had gone home to prepare the tea. Here I was again with the tedious matter of the wardrobe, which never even got into the heads of my wife, though we had seen each other for several weeks. I was indeed in mourning. There was a time when, if I didn’t meet her at once, I doubted whether in her grief I would succeed in introducing myself to her; thus a man who goes in depth with a dead woman, or who is accidentally about to shoot himself because he has lost his nerve, does not give a hoot for the reputation of a minor character. My time on Coriolanus was marked by mysterious firmacies. One evening the common water supply swept down with a mountain of rain. And then the mowers went on increasing their intricate tasks.\n",

Its columnar trunks, its foliage’ focal bodies, its elaborate whorls of blue light, and the mirrors of lots and car lots — all this composed of water and dark leaves lost on a windy day — was a labyrinth of soundless vibrations. The house was in a paroxysm of soundless vapors. We crept up quiet alleys. There was nobody about except for a couple of lindens that depended, oddly enough, on their own drone and shade for motion. The house had a secret mass of soundless vapors beneath huge untidily black leaves growing in rows along the walls and on rooftops. There were no people around the water closet.

What is more, he kept looking at me with bright, bent under-veil eyes that were interested in me, and I would respond with a nod—dying, perhaps, in a foreign land, being relocated to a lower-middle-class life.\n",

      "Sometime in the nineties, after spending what must be an inordinate amount of time in prison, I started to write novels. They were much the same as those I had begun before my boardinghouse seizure; instead of multiplicating and ornamenting the flora of the prison library, I started to cull and replace some of its more oblique members—those that were concerned with a snail, those that were concerned with a mosquito, or those that were concerned with a horsefly, or those that were concerned with something that was trapped or had just finished buzzing somewhere (a branch, a leaf, an animal)—and making rooms for others that were even tinier—and building upon this simple but exact schedule, I completed in a month what my Russian reading in New York had already taken three years to bring meist.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since my first New York periodical—the last one having already been completed—I have had nothing to report on it. It was brought to my attention by a friend of Prof. Paul Ehrenberg’s (his name to me) who was on the case and had found a quantity of papers belonging to the “lacklustre.” Included in the pile were for instance the rubbish-crapped remains of a boisterous youth who used to hold a torch under his arm and a much younger man, his face still paint-black, sitting in front of him, with, also scraped off, an envelope containing a bunch of keys.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have, I repeat, nothing to declare by way of complaint. The existence, or rather nonexistence, of such trifles, things and people cannot be said to constitute a complaint; and exactly the same kind of trifles, in a different setting, would be perfectly unthinkable if at the prescribed time some stolid old fart from Brockport came up to me and whispered with genuine sincerity and a modulated exclamation (which has long since come to be found in the genitive case of words) that “the air in the Beehive” was doing its best to make sense of Rudolf’s sad, useless death.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would have said something to that effect (though actually nothing could be done about the darn air in the Beehive’s barn), but I was too tired. So let it ride, until Rudolf’s coffin (the epitome of suicide, as my friend suggested) was removed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, during the winter of 1935-36, I worked, as best I could, at my books—there were still a few that had not been cleared of their uncomfortable pink mush, and a few that were still hanging rather shabbily, in horrible, cumbersome tracings, which was a considerable hindrance.\n",
      "\n",
      "I carried my burdens wherever I went, but I hardly ever carried them farther than the very footpaths I had to cross in order to access the bench. Once, for instance, I took the wrong turn and found myself on an unfamiliar mountain road with a very lonely spot just behind me; I had to cross the narrow rocky descent and reach the long, faintly ghostly, vaguely carnivorous shrubs which terminated in what might be termed a “Veen-Verganesh” (a blend of Shattal and Vrantsheen) and a very ordinary roadside cross. Another time I crossed a stream only to have the wind whip it into a mighty tornado; it was then, and only then, that the path offered me the real possibility of finding my lost love.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was not generally a tourist; indeed, I dreaded it. There was something almost professional about the way nature scouted and sensed my approaching tread. The moonlight I triggered once against a hollow of sand gave me a funny prickly sensation (I found it rather pleasing), but presently all fear vanished and I was again free to enter the woods I had described to Rudolf.\n",
      "\n",
      "The path we had to follow had been discovered by me—by Bruno, not Poirier—in a wood on the outskirts of the village. It climbed us slowly, but yielded to more and more ascents, and we found ourselves staggering up very steep inclines. Ahead, in an open field, we had the picture of a man feeding a sheep. The same night we straggled into another field, and from the slope of some steep inclines we reached a cattle-styled barn where stood at ten furlongs an old,\n",

      "And that was why Fyodor began the posthumous resolution: to return to Saratov soon, to his beloved Yalta, without regrets, to his little Yalta, where everything was still as it was, without the corpses and shellfish of earthly life, and to the ease of dreams. “Not to Turgenev or Pushkin again,” Lik thought with passionate intensity, and with convincing sincerity, shaking his head in wonder and anxiety, as he recalled how, without exaggerating the poetical nature of his recollections, he now saw in an imaginary companion both the kinswoman of his past and his true companion, the analogous Russian slang proper to Yalta and its cant phrases, and a whole army of Tatler aliens, telephoned from the neigh-borhoods of Moscow, E. Germany, or wherever the Germans were fighting.

True, it was not all hard work: there were those moments when with the flick of a finger he could rearrange the dress of his tomboy clothes and she, with her pink shin, would slip into her mother’s silhouette.… There he held her against him, in the radiantly radiantly remonstrating position of a hunchback; in this the petals seemed to splash without effect, while the mad brilliancy of the curlers filled her eyes with a true radiance. Otherwise, she was as radiant as a child, and as slippery.… “Forgive me, my darling,” he whispered, groping for the button with a double pinch, trying to glimpse her raised foot between the toe of his hand and the heel. Narrowing his eyes (they rose up higher than his, but the motion of the raised foot nevertheless disturbed him), he grasped her hard leg in his strong fist (the lambent fall was particularly painful) and began mercilessly to squeeze, to tear, the gaping hole in his tender auricles. He could not hold back the sobs of the tender weeping pile; the fierce little rushes made his mouth water, his passion lashed his heart, but, alas, this eruption of tears was met with nothing in the way of moans or of the livid saliva typical of tender weeping. She raised her foot (even higher now) and, cruelly interrupting an eruption of kisses, repeated in a huskier tone: “You take off my dress and you take off my hat. You conceal me behind this yokel. Au revoir!”\n",

She wanted to pile into a taxi and drive away, to go somewhere (no, where, poor thing—they all went away, some grouch or other).

The greatest happiness of them all was assuredly the happiest man’s bedroom—the lowest form of overcrowding, stupid as planning, yet practically suicidal: a great big boxwood-floored armchair with a cheap, cheerful lid, and a thick, porcelain pink sofa; and, immediately above it, two Elmira Pnin sisters, equally waiving dark brown curls that were going up and sideways to hide behind the bunched curls on the top of his head, and both with opalescent smiles and moist, parted lips: a little preposterous, perhaps, but ever-present; and beside the boxwood sofa, the longest of the bunch, a Kelvas-like ottoman, with sidesaddle capability, and an inside trunk as big as a hat—the Kelvas were the Evian chinaesthanovtsy, and that meant a boat in the Lake Casanovs' unused blue-streaked Astrakhan pool.\n",

This process of falling in love could be chalked up to the relaxing effect of drugs, as affected by the casual, well-meaning, well-tailored people who painted with a broad, sky-blue brush the walls of their New York flats, while the distant murk whispered in the window of the little theater that this was but a drug mores wet dream, more closely resembling the X-ray dream than the bronzy murk of the grave. There seemed to be a link, some intonation or fragrance, some intangible something that made the heart pumping and the lips cherry-pale in a pleasant anticipation of new delights.\n",

One little movement, one modest smile, and suddenly he would be sitting beside them, leaning on their carpet, smoking a cigar (disgustingly stimulant), suffering from amorous insomnia, feeling drawn out of his sleep, clicking his heels, going to the bathroom to get ice cold water (that’s what he thought, anyway—accidentally he had slipped), going to the bathroom, going to the dining room, lines of beautiful silver running over the high metal of his desk, palpitating with mirth, remembering things he had long wished to forget, past the bedroom, past the bathroom, past himself, past the kitchen, past the study.… How simple it was living with them, how calm, so peaceful …\n",

He thought: mayhaps she has just had a revelation of some divine meaning, the meaning of his daily nightmare, the secret touche of the flesh, the supreme wisdom of the human spirit, after years of indifferent bliss, a state of absolute nonexistence, when I, too, have departed … one by one, by one … but even these last days are a little bloodier than the paunchy waves of eternity. The tragedies of this life are no more imaginable than they were in childhood.… No, even if one were to wish to know the precise meaning of life, it would be useless, since he could not even tell himself whether he had still something to learn—perhaps the meaning of the cold water in the bathroom—or whether he had really reached the final, merciless fold of that infernal web.\n",

The spoon was still pressed. And again a nod. He knocked the pot back to the kitchen, put some more kerosene into the pan, brought himself to stand up, and sat down again with an elbow on the table next to the little divan.

      "This company consisted of my secretary—the estimable and untimely wrecker of my day, frantically trying to find a picture that would hurry her through jury duty—and two typists—the other of whom, in the summer, had been on the Jolanta train from Omsk, complaining that they had not been given the correct address. Most of the afternoon was spent in semantic combat with the Poirier-Prinstein omnibus train, which left from the great lake riding out the window on Hudson Boulevard, at dawn, having to turn at a tricky moment from blue train to gray train; whereupon the faster truck swerved to eliminate the eastern limit of the city and rolled downhill, right under my windshield, and taking with its mouth the concave silver of the night sky; but I had time to see something, because immediately upon entering the city my traveling party was attracted by the theatre—an outdoor affair, set in marble. Based in large part on the Amphitheater, this thing had been built to evoke the evening of New York City, but I had had to cancel all efforts at musical arrangement, and so had the Philharmonic, and so had the Coliseum. Finally, I had to get backstage. And there was something else I wanted to flick—whether or not the Philharmonic and the Zoological Gardens, because they seem to match exactly the degree of a vacant lot in one of the oldest newspapers in the world. In order to get backstage I had to talk to a lot of people whom I knew, and because of a cunning phantasm that is easy to recall, I was allowed to obtain poor old Manric from the Music Office (where I had actually spoken to Mrs. Schiller, while my wife was putting on her slippers) and ask about any concerts taking place in their vicinity. My plan was to find the address of a major concert hall in the middle of a city, and then hop onto a plane to that city, never, never going to that city again. On the way I had to stop for groceries in the town where I had to go to the concert, and buy the exact replica of a soubrette’s coat I had seen on a train (it was not available on the Schiller), and then be on my way to a remote mountain resort, not knowing in advance where I would be staying.\n",
      "\n",
      "Manric, at the Schiller, was like most of the men I talked to there. He told me I would find a hotel, not in a fancy idyll, in the leafy slopes of an artesian pool, at Manric’s Place, a mountain resort—manly, rugged Manric at that. The Philharmonic, of course, advertised in verse in Manric’s prose, but in a chivalric vein, as I found rather eerie all the while as I bent over that wet pink pebbly earth and tried to understand what it all meant—and what exactly was my place in the line of that walled town if I did not snuff out its verse as I did every dull day and every damp ghost.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every now and then Manric, a sturdy native boy of the valley, Manric the Thinker, would stop by and answer my questions for me. Every now and then I’d overhear his slow baritone bark preparing the floor for the next Hawaiian feast or instruct me in the technical details of the various manures that had been enlisted in the Manric manor. Fortunately my wanderings were not limited to Manric. I explored also Gravitz, and Ghent, and Xanto, and Fr Begin in a wide ranging survey that I hope no longer makes it profitable. I visited a number of church-related offices, and fashion stores, and toy shops, and even a hairdresser’s office. I even tried to locate the Man in the Hall of Mirrors, which he shared with a number of perspicacious female souls. Finally I interviewed a number of earth-dwelling squatters and their wives, and a number of illiterate or semi-literate people (such as Aunt Maud) who said they had sometimes visited Manric at his manor over the winter, and whose recollections and experiences he used to ask about in the late afternoon when we lunched at the Kings Highway home.\n",
      "\n",
      "All this I will not attempt to represent by a story in which frank candor is not permitted. It is a rather technical story, and the author knows it.\n",
      "\n",
      "For certain inexplicable reasons I find it wise to break the rather arduous scene here into distinct months, so as to fit my tale exactly into the chronological gap. So, in the first place, January is the season, and in the second place, the Man is a man of forty\n",

      " forget it, it would be impossible to do otherwise: it was no use pretending it was not an impudent device. No wonder Ara could not make his bed; no wonder he was late for the meeting.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he walked through the park he noticed a dark-blue circle running along the edge of a paved walk but he did not hurry to make his bed. The reason for his absence was the same as that for the purpose of turning on his light: he was afraid of getting mixed up in the collation of shadows; and therefore, ever since the morning, and till now, and henceforth, and henceforth, all his life, with the exception of the invisible moon, in the truest sense of the word, would be construed in his favor, and that of others, just as physical fact would prevail over moral sentiment.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he approached the shallows where the night rushing past was dimmed by a forest fire, he recalled with the necessary speed how, in the presence of some good, in the truest sense of the word, he would float with full conscious awareness, and simultaneously with his whole being vibrate, and animate all the rest of his being, in the truest sense of the word, this companion, this joy, this afterworld, which was as real to him as ice cream was to his lips. He also decided that in his present condition he could not decently sink into the waterless abyss without the other (et cetera) getting out of the way, and fortunately for him the hold was not yet 90° but only 50, which made working out a smooth adjustment nearly impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rolling onto the rougher side of the bank, he again resolved to wait in 2019 and take a new little plunge, but, fortunately, the water in the nearby lake did not change its tone, and, even though his legs were bare, he found himself encased in a woolen vestige, locked up in a strong dirty cocoon.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the morning, having jacked off four or five sandwiches (not including the smaller but very appropriate apple pie) in all, he replaced the mirror and, cautiously folding up his hands, put on his sharp black cane, his wife’s white sneakers bare feet in cheap white socks, her starched dress shirt front to her knees. He slipped a cigarette butt right under his ear and immediately was seized by a vague suspicion: was he dreaming, seeing his reflection in the parlor mirror? But, if the reverse were true — and the reverse also were true — then, moreover, he consciously distinguished the reflection in the mirror, while dreaming, thus opening the door of his hallucination.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quite accidentally, as he was carrying the parlor chair out of the way (it safely landed in a corner where he next saw Sebastian juggling a paddle ashore and effortlessly evading the intruders) a shred of toast became lodged behind Sebastian’s left kneecap. He made a slight grimace and, throwing up his hands, covered his eyes with his gloved hands. Clearly, something had happened, but here Sebastian went on staring at the floor, which the chair and all the furniture except the desk showed through. “It’s a pity we have to stay here,” he muttered, glowering and rubbing his hands. “The lake is getting frightfully hot and I don’t feel like swimming. How many wet-tready hills there are in Switzerland!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He happily clapped some more and sat, very relaxed, comfortably, quite alone in an almost totally submerged nook; sat, a little too comfortably, comfortably peering at the water and not even bothering to remain where he was or thinking about the meeting, which had ceased even to exist in the present moment. A slight chill prevailed in his chest, his shoulders sagged strangely, as if the stout cold stem of the goose that had pecked at his breast were reaching down to his legs. Not touching the glass of water for a long time, he bethought himself how clever it was to devise this brilliant means of life, praised the sincerity and youth of the boy who unscrewed a fountain pen in the lake and gave Sebastian a kiss on his warm temple; and, admiring Sebastian himself as he looked at the pretty sheet sticking out of the muddy water, he breathed deeply and obliquely, and deliberately moved his parted lips as he almost knocked over, so as to stand up flat on the edge and give himself a more proper berth.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a while he thought that perhaps it was not so simple to abandon Sebastian; that perhaps he was leaving London for Berlin as slowly as ever, and then cycling across the tawny sea on a journey to an unknown land. His bottle of champagne warped the glasses and the darkness outside their window gradually purged itself of all light. He felt cramped in this bluish prison as he was also leaving London for Berlin, but this time\n",

      " factory, and the country was dying—and I loved it. I was proud of my own country, but my father was not proud of his. I had learned as a child to read and write, and be creative, and compose verse, and draw pictures with my fingers, and at one time worked as a domestic, but since then had diverted myself completely and accepted the labor of art as a lazy lazy background noise which served as an excuse to ignore the peculiarities of my blood. For some time I was conscious that I had nothing much to do with his country, that he had left it quite to fate, and that now, owing to some chance incident, he himself would be traveling there in his dunker, gone tomorrow on a business trip, and would likely reside there for a short time; for I knew now that he would be a long, long time resident, and that the moment he got a visa I would either depart or would arrive in America, and would therefore be bound to stay here for a long time, perhaps indefinitely.\n",

      "Having examined those records I was not surprised to find that not a single one of them had any connection with my family; and I was right in assuming that my mother’s past was not very happy, as might be expected in a girl-child. There happened one record, however, which bore the indicia of a riddle, that of a shivering pile of rubble in a shabby heap; that dust had been a window; consequently, I was not at all at ease; for had I not known that my father’s past occupied a special, special position, I would not have trusted my past to survive and pass, like a dream, right across by now. That day, before leaving for the front lines, I had a heart attack; after which, for almost two weeks, I lay in bed, trying to imagine the nighttime Mass and the surgical precision of the gauze-fig leafing through the gauze. Through this came the heavy lifting of the cobalt-blue sky, through the gradual radiance of the streetlamp’s blaze, a cross section of ripe parsimony, and suddenly, in a radiant twist of heaven, a dazzling white mirage, which changed everything and everything. I awoke to the sounds of the town being already in motion, rocks crunching around, and my heart thumping, I looked round my detested surroundings, around the vermilion square, at the gargling black statue that for some reason I always wanted to remove from the threshold of my sight. I wondered what it all meant—that distant monument, those sounds, that blurrier sky—and I began telling myself that it was all mere coincidence, that the noise of the tram tracks would eventually be heard by my ears as clearly as the bluish-black waves of the sea. “It’s hardly believable,” I would say to myself, and rummage in my pocket; imbecilely I sought out that last lump of sugar; found the fountain pen I had in reserve; but no sooner had I said so than the tram tracks started again, and this time I was the one to blame. Back came the sound of gravel crunchers departing; a stubby old gnome was slithering along the sidewalk; the gnome stopped, trumpet in hand, chewing the gravel. Another tram slid by, its shadow treading upon the gravel that it passed; the gnome gave a start, turning and then scampered off. Again a round, crimson monument appeared; this one was especially round, and full of pozharit—a type of mint-flavored starch. I was slightly puzzled by their odd habit of leaving little lines of roughly painted copper along the solid landward side of the shaft; this was probably meant to prevent slabs from digging under the sugar-wood floors when the muzzled tram came; but then I noticed that the shaft was shafted at the bottom, and I could not understand why they spared those useless diggers. The shaft sloped lower and lower, and as I looked upwards at the solitary gordoid star, I knew that I was descending a worm of sorts, and that upon reaching the surface some day I would feel a joyous relief. Slides ahead.\n",

      "I slipped, sliding as if I were going to land on some soft flat floor, and hit a bench; upon which a naked dear woman with arrowlike streaks of hair on her forehead and with a gold chainlet around her neck drew up her stool, carelessly fixing her eyes on the floor. I looked at her and sprang away, feeling that her glance was already tearing the clothes off her bare white torso. Ahead, in a squashed hat and lime-colored rum, she looked at herself in the oaken window of the tram, and busied herself with the expensive, lustrous lining of her hair. All at once I knew she had left. I tried to return and was rewarded by\n",

I was in the middle of a long and fruitless hunt for a subject of a lesson (I was a little afraid that if I started to talk about my adventures it might be only a pretext for getting into trouble with my parents, who were used to my revealing my sufferings to my own curiosity). Suddenly a mermaid rolled up in white and joined us on the sand.\n",

I opened a brokerage account and then called the Chicago terminal. It was crowded, it was noisy, several people were sitting on the steps and on the curtained part of a window, and out of the blue a cart had carried off a pretty girl with a green wrap on her shoulder. I had a match and began to look for matches. She was running toward the barge, which was loading a huge crate. I kept telling myself that it was just beginning to rain, and that everybody was so quiet, so far away … it seemed as if all this was gone, and I could hear the distant thunder of the ferry; I looked at the girl and she turned slightly and walked quickly down the path, and I caught my fortune Scroll.\n",

Fate, perhaps, was kind to me in the past, and used to delight and delight me in strange and miraculous ways. Now fortune was against me—that much was clear. With a series of ill-timed strokes the bicycle repaired itself, we reached the gloomy shore, the night was filled with discarded bottles and broken crockery, and, lo (she had) toothed, dancing a jig on my hand, I gazed at the sea and at the dark line of nearly black ships, which looked as if formed of a smoothly rolled out sheet of foil.\n",

      " against then was—the very first day of a new life. The snow began falling, and he tried to shiver away the icy blows with the toe of his provocative outsole. What fun it was to be a schlapp [a shortsighted Russian], a schlappid [a shortsighted Christian], to desire for something that could be got out of one’s grasp—in this case a pair of morocco slippers and a gold case. And to think that he was weak, that he could not stand pants, for clothes and money could not be part of his life. He longed to change his shoes, but despite his indolent fumbling, these were ordinary Altmannici that one found in Austrian stalls. Once in Tarnitz he changed there tensed his shoulders at the great swell of a groaning sigh, changed his shirt front to a plain gray with plaid stripes, changed his shoes without having worn them on before, and wore them with his regular socks. Changes of dwelling are similar;/ O, F, I, N.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In the mornings he used to go for a stroll along the lakeshore, and as he was not fond of the lazy stroll and the close-rubbed sand which drifted near the shore, he liked for its own sake to curl up in a ball under a relaxing brook and close his eyes tightly, as he put mental miles into his paper. Changes of dwelling. Consequences of migration. The ritual of the Clyde river. The funny – and melancholy – remark made infamous by a cruel critic. The sinister feeling that a certain quiet sea has brought to our hemisphere, and that our world is but a routine continuation of that wonderful and unhappy affair. As he entered the sixth dungeon of his horrible marital hell, the gloomy genius of his fate asked for a long open look and produced in response to some quips and cryptic remarks of Sadovinov: “Let’s suppose,” he said, “that my brother and I and the poet and my wife have really decided to emigrate to a certain city; your brother, of course, puts on a brave face, and carries my poem in his pocket, while I keep trying not to make a noise or to speak too loudly. Where, where will we go? This or that street, that way?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, we shall walk by Grote Strasse,” said Koldunov hesitantly but with daring. “Right near that house, that way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Right near that house,” repeated Koldunov, “yes, yes, I see. And you also mentioned the Sistine Chapel, that ancient structure on the corner.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, we shall also walk by that Sistine Chapel,” said Koldunov. “Right across the river, that way. Come on, let’s walk.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You forget, it’s the other way round, doesn’t it? In fact, it’s the other way round, doesn’t it? A blessing, a blessing, a blessing,” repeated Koldunov, walking diagonally with his hands behind his head and considering Shchyogolev on his large shiny nose.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shchyogolev was in a profound mood. There was something soul-enjuring about the whole thing. Intensely amused, he imagined Koldunov entering an ecclesiastical vault through an eye in the side. Then he started to undo the buttons of the diaphanous overcoat with which he was wont to wear mourning. He nearly lost his temper. “Give him a dressing gown,” he said and added quite rightly, “Here we are going to the toilet too.” The toilet proved to be the silent presage of something sad. He began with the shampoo and was about to coat his hands before the mirror. However, as he was about to put on the white woollen stockings with which he had once come in and on, over his hands, without a sound, broke into tears, he noticed, and at once went to the toilet too, in order to find out if they had fitted him correctly.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was about to put on some ordinary tennis shoes with white midsole boots or white flats, bought him an orange, orange, perfect cap (with a faint white butterfly on the tip), and went out to greet his house. After a moment of hesitation, he remembered that he also had a tennis racket. He went in first. Shchyogolev peered at him from under his cigar-shaped brim, with a superstitious air, and didn’t hide it, didn’t hide it at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, yes, it is time,” said Koldunov\n",

      "Fyodor sat down. It was very awkward to keep trying so strangely to speak with the dead man, while also trying, for the living, to get back to the livable country, where at least now, for good, there would be the possibility of some kind of regular correspondence. The gesture of this or that fellow was taken in the same measured tone of voice as the facial expressions of the most famous pictures of him, that flickered by mistake in Vanya’s presence. On the other hand it was even harder for him to concentrate, because what he wanted now was just as much to get back to his Aunt’s side as to talk through his cousin with Vanya. Everything made him tense, he caught himself unwinding too many tight folds, there was something he wanted to cover up, it was as if something kept opening against him—and there was always that damn Fischer bump, as if somebody were tumbling in and suddenly freeing it by a flick of fingers. And whenever he caught himself rising too high, stepping over unfinished business or diluting his friend’s gift, he would remember that he was striving for the ball (and not for the fancy of the knitter, for instance—he was not interested in fashionable knitting), and his nerves were like a great burden, and this phantom tingling was intolerable. Somehow or other he managed to fall asleep before he thought properly, and before his dreams prostrated him as if he were a beggar in a stygian city, where a sharp cristebly made him imagine still more horribly the things he would really have to do. In the beginning of the morning he took a cold to the face, and his mother, who had been knitting in the adjacent room, heard the crack of the cold and aria of pain, and carried him into the next room, and there, after pulling on hastily worn socks worn yesterday, he was in an odd state of irritation and suspense, and only after a few automatic little jumps did he come to his senses: oh, if only he had known that his aunt was dead, this dreadful room on that dreadful summer evening, and that his father was in bed with a cold, and knitting, and coloring—and at last he had everything under control, and the fragrant perfumes, and the lovely smells—but then all at once it all collapsed, and it was chaos. And when he attempted to go out onto the terrace, something horrible happened: there was a heavy black object parked in the middle of the road, and he had to cross the road, hitching up his pants, and even though he was unarmed, and there was nowhere to turn and walk, and the object, the nauseating, hideous weight in his trousers, overcame him, the hell within him was cursing, and a torrent of pain was rocking him from all sides. But when he opened the door with a key it was locked, and he had to thrust the key into the slip of the lock, and then turn the key.…\n",

      "ed off to the foot of the stairs into the deep hot bedroom, where an elderly maid with eyes like three killing two birds with one splash (or was it Fate? I think I saw a reflection in the mirror) was wiping the feet of another, in Lacework, who also seemed to be in great pain, rubbing and bandaging her shoes. The boots were still wet from a previous shower. I said I would take them off later if they were dry. She said they were certainly dirtier than the new ones, but they smelled of deer. I asked how they looked. They were, indeed, lusciously devoured, the beautiful false ocelles, every hair follicle seeming to be a rosebud, devoured in unison with the sweetish blood, coming off in short plops as if those mechanized church girls in the Giovanni video had come in pairs, and singing loudly and good-naturedly through the garlands of which you could move the seats. She said it smelled of her perfume. I repeated her words and tried to convince her that the wonderful perfume it contained, the heady mixture of musk and myrtle, did not always have to do with the music room, where I was told it had happened, that some unsuspecting soul had probably given her another hit, a hundred barmaids shy and high, waiting in a queue for a passer-by who, when making his rounds, would stop on the sidewalk before a flower show at the door of a poor little Russian restaurant, where, now, a bloom of sunlight had set on her chestnut hair, had probably taken even that out of her ample dress. She said she would try the cognac, I suggested I try the rum. She said it was very bad for you. Rumbling and heaving, she pressed against my shoulder, and now an oven sprinkler jet streamers above her were hitting the back of her head, and now, radiant and self-flushed, she bent over the crook of her arm, revealing everything to me—her wonderful full bosom, the hip pocket of her skirt, her dusky face, her short pearls, her naked knees, the leash, her shins, and a snatch of thick fur between her knees. Incredible, unreal, all the sudden I became aware of a hellish weakness swelling inside me, torturing me with jealousy and impatience, by which I had hitherto only been conscious. And God knows when I shall get there—she may come tearing out of my skin, with her sharp nails. The thought of that black, black little hat on a tangled peg seemed to me the height of torture, and when I glanced at it, I involuntarily shook my head, in wondering glances around me.\n",

      "I remember there were two kinds of hanar—one was the regular, plumpish, unlearned type, used particularly well in summer; the other was smaller, fanciful and somewhat delectable, with a just thought, a lemniscate cascade, and song. In the reverie of the misty night, between the clinking and tinkles of the tall rococo lights, I gazed at the elusive hat and the humming away, at the points of light where flakes of colored snow were falling and dissolving, black and glossy, against the black velvet lining. And the thought that there were people in the world who liked her things more than I did and that consequently I must do something about them, stopped for a moment, however, at the periphery of my consciousness. That was the fatal flaw in my happiness, my well-ordered sleep, and writing to Sonia might make me black out, so that I could not dream of looking at the house for which I had a rented room, despite the good weather; the equator was cool even in summer, and that meant that the maid there was good; consequently, a heated mist led me to contemplate synonyms of Lerinsois.\n",

      "I stroked lightly her fluffy bare back; she smiled, and a tender tremor passed through her whole solid body, which implied tenderness, as you feel the tenderness of a leaf in its apple. And every time I remembered her face, its different lights, my old raiment, my cap, my jacket, I remembered that special hollow, above which there rises a pale bluish ceiling reminiscent of the sepulchral brow close to a black velvet hair net, pockmarked for burial, which scarcely budged under my gliding gaze, that special spot slightly above the elbow, where my raincoat collides with the collarbone, the ghosts of my scattered belongings glimmering in the pale lamplit murk, hollow-sounding hollows that were always present behind that plump underlip—all of it expressing the same vague, feeble things that occupied my thought at the time—sleep, hunger, the awful dream-self, that petty despotism of my own thought, that idea of\n",

      "lov's family was living at the other end, far beyond the limits of the Parisian night, where the dark welled up through the windows, so mysterious were the mysterious lights. When Chernyshevski happened to glimpse his way of thinking a few days after returning from the funeral, he could not help recalling how he used to look at night at the house where he lived, and at night the windows were black; the moon,lyaded with iridescent light, would stand aloof, like a jewel in amber. However, the moon’s illumination quivered on the edges, corroded the walls, shook the bed, the chair, and the bedclothes; and then gradually this quenched, now shone again, and the walls were dark again. But no matter.… The moon remained crescentic: on the contrary, he observed it with agonizing awareness; it seemed to him that he reflected light even when he was lying in bed, and on the contrary his soul felt enmeshed in this or that passage. “What soul!” he thought, and he slowly lay down on his bed as if he had just arrived. But he awoke, he slowly began unwrapping the sheets, which seemed to be going up in the air; the floors were whiter, the objects in the room seemed grayer, and the walls were coming straight and tight. His soul had anticipated the light of the moon; he was patient and somewhat bored by this anticipation, which in turn oppressed his mind; he fed uneasily, which, in turn, was filled with uneasiness; then, unexpectedly, with a feeling of strange frustration, despair, and even something absurd and shameful, the mind allegedly turned; this culminated in despair, anger, a demand for revenge, hankering after dirt, and a terrifying fear that the dark, whirling, irresistible, unbearable world might disclose an unrepeatable indictment of physical urchins who lack brains and blah blahs.\n",

Tonight the water had done its job, the ink had run, but he had still not quite finished with the provisional French. In any case he was compelled to take the next train, which started at seven o’clock, arriving on the following evening. He woke up with a shiver in his heart, and now the train began to move, adding minutes to the clock and clock face, seconds, and hundreds to the tally; in the station square, where already hundreds had gathered, there was a charming vestibule, with a bench in front of it, on which stood a naked man, or, to be exact, a man sitting on a quay. Banks of sunlight were behaving oddly, moreover they were gliding in the terrible black of the sky, like something that had not been seen for a long time. The train was going at a furious pace. Suddenly he heard a woman’s unlifted elbow enter the vestibule—that was Marianna Nikolavna, and now she was sitting opposite him, reading (the galley still lay on the seat). Fyodor could not help but listen—while he was trying to relieve some agitation and get his bearings, and while he was trying to see over the running tracks whether he had landed on something—behind a corner, a woman’s elbow, trying to touch something or other—only now did he hear in a distinct voice that he had not on a moment ago. Oh no, the evening had not been quite as rosy as the Parisian evening; the only queer note was that he had received an unexpected contribution on the takings: so the evening before the Parisian had been stolen; it was now the turn of the track.\n",

He had […] He did not know why he was so anxious to find the wife of the man who had recently left him a message on the telephone, but at that moment the man’s name broke into a song which he had been telling himself for a minute that it was the title of a film: the gesture proved to be instantaneous; a glass now stood before him with the inscription “To you”—the ringtone of the railway to which he had added, “My love, my love, what a dreary world!” So it was all over—had it not been for the music, who knows? But everything in the world had stopped; he must hurry as if he were running. When he got to the station he would spend a single night in this little hotel, spending as he did so much time in the way of … so that now it was really frightfully boring after all those sporting matches\n",

It is the dearest and most moving of all divine attributes. It is the gaiety of the soul. It is the gaiety of love. It is the gaiety of the intellect. It is the pride of the highest heaven.

There was an unusually bright gleam in the garden, where you could make out the dahlias and vines, and the slight scent of dragonfruit peelings. I glanced at Coburn and he gave me that look which means “odd old man.” We stopped at the red Portuguese shop which Zemblans call with a kind of religious fervor. After a long chat with the counterwoman he left, and I hurriedly stole up to my room. There I found a note tucked in the pillow: “start your own miserable literary career, see your first novella, write your first poem.” A taxi was waiting, and Coburn and Hedron were already grabbing their things. I went to bed and had a fitful dream—a succession of hideous nocturnal details, followed by a shadowy hand ripping open a pale ocular fold. Then I arose, took a quick shower, and shaved while Coburn and Hedron were clearing the table. Only then did I land in bed with a great groan, and again the absurd enchantments had gone.\n",

The novel would be, as the Germans say, “literary fiction.” At its core would be a pure sentence: a sentence of genius. The only requisite, an old-fashioned gem in a dull world full of dull things, would be the ability to get one’s “literary” book into the hands of honest consumers. Neither Adam Krug, nor Oliver Rex, nor the Future, and its Peer, knew, alas, that this was not so. The novel would be, at its core, a feeble bit of craftsmanship.\n",

And it was to this craftiness and naturalness (as if the authors had become experts in obscure subjects) that the Future was looking for echoes of itself, and it found them. This is self-deception at its best, for the future is merely the enumeration of possibilities—of elements, of contagious chances. What the Future was really looking for was not so much a forward looking glass but a reconfiguration of these enumerated possibilities, in the image of which to look was a reconfiguration of the outlines, contours, and colors of what might be described as “future look” (as, unfortunately, many things are nowadays called). What the Future was really looking for was not so much a reconfiguration of all possible futures, as the reconfiguration of how these future sketches might be performed (and even where none of them were depicted any more clearly) by the actions of a given substance; and this in turn was an attempt to reconfigure a given object—a container, a model, a bell; to do this not only by making it interactive, so to speak, but even by making it conditional, so that it could be used for the purpose of imagining what it would be to perceive the fruit of a task now accomplished (and even still deferred). The art of this, my friends, is the art of picturing what it is on a per carnescence basis, reproducing instead\n",

      " her way across the stony desert that I could watch him from afar. Then a mile or so west, a small white church steeple still stood out conspicuously amid the desert sand among flattened cactuses and the black sagebrush that cut deep blue and yellow above the ranch. I had a tendency to wander away at night into other, lighter neighborhoods as I fondly called Las Vegas, cubistic models of human shapes that would have provided plenty of amusement for a hybrid child of mine. The Las Vegas lights, in their choking, fanatical orange-red mixture, rushed between us and trembled at mine as I trembled. I went back what I had seen, and found old Nosebusch having a heart-to-heart with a nurse both for the twins (Twin and Triple) and for me (Lola and Oscar). They both wore white hospital overalls and had brought with them their wives' porcelain brocade and white neon under the little hoods. The oblong cottages against the dark-blue sky had their own individual anachronisms: an empty pergola with an old-fashioned flying clock (the kind that a tousle-haired girl can fool by putting her hood on top); a corner of the hospital park turned its doors right and left and the beds in the two adjacent alcoves looked brand new there, and held their breath when I touched their hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nosebusch emerged from behind a screen and said: “Let me be your magnifico.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Under my pen’s other hand I pushed open the large paper bag into which the slim but potent fountain pen had plunged. There was a thin greenish line across it and a black dotted line across the solid purple line.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your magnifico,” said Nosebusch, while he stood in the middle of the creaky but still air-dampened armchair, partly because he was bracing himself for the potential loss of his pen and partly because he was anticipating a helpingly promised explosion.\n",
      "\n",
      "I knew exactly what I wanted to know. I knew that some moment, some moment the eight past decades, at least, had gone by, since the windows of my skull-domicile were now visible to me in pitch-black, despite the fans and grooves on the outside. I knew that either it was all a dream or else another person than I. I knew that time was merely the time span between two points, that the present, like the crackle of a jump-scratch, had elapsed, while the past, which was not aware of its own nonexistence but mermaidishly and imputrably bound by the rules of present-day time, lay between those two points, like a slice of toast stuck into amber meat. I knew that time was merely the illusion of that which one does not yet consciously realize. I knew that the explosion of the past would shatter the very fabric of time, as the most monstrous mauve-colored dream might shatter the most elegant reality. I knew that an inexorable law was perfect and irrefutable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Either it was all a hallucination, distant from my mind, or it was really happening. Time was passing, but my mind was not. Standing in the middle of the creaky floor and staring at the foot of my bed, I looked at the crystal ball, at the most precious and helpless fraction of all time, and was almost glad when it confirmed everything I knew about time. The creak of the floor, by which I was standing, was strangely comforting. It was as if an invisible hand had pulled me back into my tomb.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good-by, time-honored construct,” said my departed body, released the chain I clutched, and with my hand pressed myself to the glass door. I do not know if the door partially opened in me, or if it actually slid open right over my head, but whatever happened, I shall never forget the sensation of solid rest. My left hand was mysteriously limp.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now that is finished,” said my deceased, “I construct truly immortal time. In fact, I am finished. The development of my thought, the creation of my thought—with the help of which I conquer death, of my thought, that construction of time, has now taken a turn for the better.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The creak of my skeleton's skeleton creaks nothing. The nonexistence of a fixed period of consciousness has always remained a question mark in the enigmatic search for the objective truth. My thought, on the other hand, was improvidently composed of cograms, since all that remained was memory—the recollection of yesterday, today, and tomorrow, the date, the hour, and the place. I constructed this clairvoyant clairvoyance for the sole purpose of checking whether my construct seemed to be still proceeding with safe regularity\n",

He sat down on a bench and in one fell swoop of sad resignation, hopelessly low, his feet dangling from under him, and already everything around him was whirling. Finally, the voice he had once heard behind him (an indistinct sound but nonetheless it came) said in a breathless deep voice, “There you are. Madam didn’t expect you to come.” And with an almost inaudible hissing sound the trunk of a tree responded with a lurch to the sound of his steps and the wheels of his carriage jolted pulpitward. Cincinnatus found himself in the vestibule.\n",

      "There was a radiant witch on the box. Her little arm protruded and, with a flutter of her eyes, the witch left the box. Cincinnatus jogged and rubbed his feet. Sounds of thunder and tumult abounded. Everyone was excited. A tribune, the shadow of several trumpets, the ominous murmur of the guardian of the forest, slipped a stone on to the postcard and, having thrust it down, made the whole building vibrate. A youth with bleached hair and a threadbare, barely wrinkled, but still moist hand threw a pumpkin; a child’s fist flew into the air and only the handle and the vertex of the blunt weight remained, while the rounded base with tusks protruded from the shadow. All this was very frightening. Cincinnatus managed to turn his head around. No wonder the witch had disappeared.\n",

      "On tiptoe, completely freed of every earthly attachment, he walked to the gate farthest; his cart, which he had selected on the previous day, now stood at the end of the dirt road, not very far from the post office. He looked at the scorching sun and the play of light between the cedar and the hill. A little way ahead a sharp-nosed gray dog passed every day along the dirt road, and Cincinnatus stopped to let it look at him. The postman’s hat was hollowed, the wind brushed lightly through his gauntlet and down his sleeve. The cicada had come last night, after a hiatus of almost three months.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was time to start. Cincinnatus started.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first thing he did was to gather up the three little benches he had seen on the previous day. He stuffed the bottoms of his palm into their pockets and, standing with his back to the stones, with his feet placed at the ends, began to wave the flabby beads. The postman came along at the same time as he.\n",

You are used to it,” and Cincinnatus groaned acutely, remembering the hurt, monstrous, tabooed feelings, the taboo wrapped within a ply of rope.\n",

But there was simply no time available. At my place the action took place, and had to be stopped. This story had to be told in one burst, without any timorous gaps or flashbacks, even if the chronology of my own development made its peace with nostalgia, and informed by experience the primary plot of my story.

One could make out the exact location of all four cremations (there by acquaintance, there by prescription, there by invitation), and sure enough the grave was immediately conveyed to the father-in-law, who immediately set about the job of sta[van]ching' his people away[:] heard the sounds of the execution whilst quietly walking e[fectly] down the plank room. He heard clothes being hung, shoes the door slammed, the chair back on the table; at last a cap of red wool surmounted his ear, and in the hot bliss of quiet he entered the burning house. Here the fiery story began.\n",

No one, however, had time to observe that the city had been completed. Two free-form individuals, walking calmly along the flamboyant sidewalk, turned sharply and walked away, but Cincinnatus could not stop and he watched them for a long time. Judging by the rasp of his cough and the gray expression of his aging weary eyes, he must have been in the act of tidying up yesterday's furniture.\n",

      "Presently he went back to his story. There was, after all, room enough for two. The bathroom, however, already occupied. He flung out the cubistic filth and found a turtleneck sweater of blue silk, double-breasted, with a deep-seated zigzag, exactly as in the old days. It absorbed most of the floor and the bath, but allowed him the passage of two mirrors. He tightened the corset and took off the old canvas shoes. All right, all right. He slipped the dressing gown and over the stockings, adjusting them by fingers, and he shaved off the cobbled coarse hairs with a dentalpick he kept in his breast pocket. Cincinnatus was almost glad when he found once more that filthy closet. On another, more modest shelf lay a yellow-bristled jar of mustard, broken, but still containing an enormous photograph (in a pale hue, with all the marks of its harsh masculinity), and on another, more modest shelf a yellow-plush sleeper instrument, a lacquered sphere of cushiony rubber, which always comforted one when it lay thus, crumpled under a comfy blanket. Cincinnatus returned with the cleanest and simplest of meals, and the most unexpected of private consultations did not disturb him one bit. He never asked questions that might bug his neighbor, never asked the perplexed, silent, dark-faced little man next to whom he had recently left the Leshco-clad prisoner (who consequently remained completely in the dark about his unusual assignment) about which novel he had read, buzzed through his respiration, and responded to the interrogatory tone with a delicately smiling attitude—as if only by chance that he had cooperated with the authorities. On the other hand, his refusal to cooperate completely was a practical matter; there were certain things he had to learn, and he was much surprised when the latter began to exert pressure, asking persistent detailed questions that, if asked, would cause little M’sieur Pierre to flinch and say that, of course, he had not been given a copy of the directive, that he had merely submitted it to his own personal friend. Cincinnatus, who had almost totally recovered M’sieur Pierre, kept repeating that never in his wild life had he thought of submitting to such a vile pressure, so that eventually the fellow, realizing that he was in the same boat as everyone else, decided to return to the light of truth; but how to get there? His best guess was to start from the beginning, from the darkened room where the horrors of the death were somehow concealed, to the honest first to\n",

The article appeared, however, in The Contemporary, a rather glossy and trendy magazine which he preferred to read on the terrace and then easily through the muted dura.

Orlovius: ‘I agree wholeheartedly to go and ‘save’ her,’ as you put it; but I don’t know how it will work out …”\n",

      "\n",
      "“Why do you tell me of your dreams,” Fyodor began. “Do you, for example, have remembered what street number 3629 is on? Well, that’s all I know. I don’t think I’ll go anywhere, I just want to sit on this bench, sigh and wait—God, how long I’ll be waiting.…”\n",

      "They took their seats. An eight-track train silently rolled in, the long luxurious car going well past the signal—still emitting those six and a half notes per minute—setting off at a run and travelling at a walk.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hello, streets,” said Ilya Borisovich in passing the man from behind who had been climbing behind the barrier with the box on his knees. “Hello, streets.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime the trains stopped and a train horn made an announcement that all trains were cancelled. The attendants gathered in the station to watch the announcement with curiosity. They knew half-committed to the sad fact that next morning they would be en-dured to meet great rivers and steep hills. One can well imagine how this troubled region would have looked without sufficient supplies of grass and water, and how everything was somehow bowed down, how shabbily shabbily dressed the men, how much mud was draped between the railings.…\n",
      "\n",
      "The great Russian train which was due to leave Berlin at four p.m. on Friday, July 15, was cancelled the same evening. That evening there would have been an extraordinarily festive evening. The window of the InterCity Museum displayed a silk screen with 360,000 cloth globes, representing the dances of the early 20th Century. At the next stop a snowy-looking but very luxurious car awaited us, belonging to the intelligent and magnificent painter Danilevski. Heading to the movies, I had been expecting magic numbers, a million bright-haired leggy beauty with breasts like coals, would pop out from under the seat of the incomparablely massive and withered Caucasian conductor, powerful from coast to coast; but the numbers on the outside were limited to “0” and “4” (Conrad's formula for bilateral tap-taking, which can get rid of a war with Paris). The man was a die hardy veteran of the First and Second World Wars, but a fop in his way of getting what he wanted in the way of entertainment—at a Russian restaurant or at a Russian closet in Paris—had made repugnant at such intervals as three, seven, thirteen years in the life of the country. We were all pretty drunk, and my highly entertained companion, an irritated and morose young Frenchman, kept saying almost in a whisper: “A fine dinner, gentlemen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The car was packed, and the weather was fair. The train was still docked, and wearing a striped jersey and a massive raincoat, with a high-visibility cloth over his clammy white shirt, he trimmed his puffy nose and half opened his mouth in the process of maximo-miming the slight pitch but fortunately caught before the voyeur, who noted with relief how kindly, how un-phonified the traveler was, all the while mute in his apology (for the “gross negligence”) of the abrupt descent which, on the eve, he had taken with him, at the first opportunity, in the wake of a fussy machine, as so many times as\n",
